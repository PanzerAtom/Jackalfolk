        <h4>Jackalfolk</h4>
        <p>Jackalfolk are humanoids that strongly resemble wild jackals, with
similar heads, tails, legs and fur colouring.
Jackalfolk do not typically have their own society, as they have
melded almost perfectly with the other humanoids that inhabit
the sands they call home, though occasionally one may find a
secluded sect of them living on their own. These small villages are
usually centered around a great shrine of one of the gods,
in most cases that god being Anubis, or whatever god of death may
call the region their domain. Many Jackalfolk are
highly religious, even the city-dwelling ones usually having a small
shrine or token of their patron god in their homes.
Jackalfolk also like to decorate their bodies with golden
paint, typically around their eyes, necks, and where
their limbs meet their torso.</p>
        <span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your 
Dexterity increases by 2, and your Wisdom score is
increased by 1<br/>
        <span class="feature">Age.</span>Jackalfolk have somewhat longer lifespans,
and grow slower, than humans. Jackalfolk reach physical
maturity around the age of 20, but many do not die until the
age of 250. Their fur begins to grey as they
approach 150 years.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Alignment.</span>Jackalfolk typically
lean towards good alignments, though they have free choice.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Size.</span>Jackalfolk stand between
6 and 7.5 feet tall and weigh roughly the same as a large
human.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Speed.</span>Your base walking
speed is 30 feet.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Darkvision</span>Your feral counterpart
is well suited for hunting at night, and as such your eyes are
adapted to low light conditions. You can see in dim light within
60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if
it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray.
        <span class="feature">Animal Senses.</span>Your sense of
smell and hearing is better than most, granting you advantage
on Wisdom (Perception), checks involving these senses.<br/>
        <span class="feature">The Desert Is Your Home.</span>
Jackalfolk are a desert-living race, and as such are 
well-adapted to extremely hot weather conditions, droughts, and
feel more at home in sandy environments. You gain advantage on
Survival checks made in desert conditions.<br/>
